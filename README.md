# Solidity Assessment

I coded this solidity program, which covers use of error handling in Solidity. Here we are going to learn about token creation and uses of minting and burning functions with much more such as transfer.

## Description

This is a simple program which is used to transfer, mint, burn, check balance and many more functions with your account. By adding address of sender, receiver and ammount you could also transfer the amount.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

Type the code after creating new file and assign it a name in Remix which is used to code in Solidity language.

Now after creating a new file and typing the code click Compile(name) then you will be able to see a green tick which means compiled successfully only if your code has no problems.

Now you need to go to deploy and run and then click on deploy button present over there which will deploy your solidity code and then you can see your result to the code in solidity language.

In the end you will be able to retrieve your result
